- Scalable Project and Folder Structure
- React navigation & Drawer navigation
- Bottom sheet navigation
- Validation and Authentication
- Toggle Password

- Axios, Instances, Interceptors etc
- Splash Screens
- Flexbox Layouts, Modals, Toasts etc
- Camera and Photo Image Pickers
- Image Cropping

The folder structure for screens and components is designed as is, so that the UI's don't care where the data comes from, in case we wish to swap the state management library to another one(context-api to redux), the UI won't be affected
